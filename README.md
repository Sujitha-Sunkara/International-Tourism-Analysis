# International-Tourism-Analysis

### Introduction:  
According to the World Tourism Organization (WTO), Tourism is defined as â€œtravelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes (Choudhary, 2017). In the year 2014, UNWTO stated that the tourism sector is becoming one of the largest and fastest growing sectors in the world for the past few decades (UNWTO, 2014). The output of this sector impacts the economy of a country directly or indirectly. This impact is more prevalent in developing countries as it plays a fundamental role in the development process. One way of measuring the impact would be monitoring the area where Gross Domestic Product Per Capita (GDP) that is driven by tourism (Voumik, Barmon, & Nath, 2014).  
 
### Overview:  
Tourism can occur within or outside the border of a country defining them as intranational or international (Mellander, 2018). For the purpose of this study, our focus will be on international tourism or travel that occurs between countries or nations.  According to the Economic Impact World (2018), the sector of travel and tourism contributes to over 313 million jobs and $ 882 billion investments. When compared to the 3% growth in the global economy, it contributes to 4.6% of the economy on a global scale.   
Tourism has evolved into a worldwide financial, social and environmental industry. Tourism is the primary source of income in many nations. The tourism industry, however, is a fast-moving industry. It is very delicate and susceptible to different variables as well. The tourism markets are also very varied for each location (nation). Tourism information is commonly accessible and updated. One of the most important report of national tourism statistics; number of tourist arrivals from each country of origin, number of departures, their average length of stay and total receipt or expenditure. International Tourist Arrivals (ITA), International Tourist Departures (ITD) and International Tourist Receipts (ITR) have traditionally been used as a benchmark aggregate series to evaluate the general significance of tourism in nations and around the world.  
The primary focus of this study is how one nation economy can be impacted by the number of tourists coming in from other nations. This can be accomplished by including global tourist arrivals and of global tourist receipts datasets. Receipts for global transport, include payments to domestic carriers. These receipts include any other payment made in advance for products or services obtained at the destination country. They may also include receipts from tourists on the same day, unless they are sufficiently essential to warrant distinct classification. All the data that is available for research is in US dollar values.  

### Research Question: 
 
* Tourism is unique and diverse with respect to the economic impact to a nation. Its impacts can begin with globally operated hotels, cruise liners, airlines to something locally operated like bed and breakfast places, or activities that include cultural awareness of the area. Some of the key research questions that can be explored in this research paper include:  
  + The contribution made to the GDP by tourism.  
  + The proportion of expenditure by continents.  
  + Is the income group of a country directly proportional to the number of tourist departures in the country?  
  + Is the expenditure of a country directly proportional to the income group of a country?  
  + Identify the top 10 countries that have experienced the most changes in expenditure.  
  + Analyze the most visited country amongst the world.  

### The Data Set:  
 
* The data sets and files that are used for the purpose of this research have been obtained from World Tourism Organization(WTO), Yearbook of Tourism Statistics, Compendium of Tourism Statistics, World Bank national accounts data and OECD National Accounts (The World Bank, 2019). Data sets shall include but may not be limited to:  
  + International Tourism, number of arrivals 
  + International Tourism, expenditures for passenger transport items (current US $) 
  + International Tourism, expenditures (% of total imports) 
  + International Tourism, expenditures (current US $) 
  + GDP (current US$) 
  + International Tourism, number of departures 
  + Shapefiles for Country borders and State Borders
